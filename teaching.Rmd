I am an R enthusiast and happy to share my knowledge in various fields of statistics.


You can find below two practice-based lessons that I created to teach `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. 

* [Lesson on dplyr](https://github.com/RemiMahmoud/data_wrangling)
* [Lesson on gpglot2](https://github.com/RemiMahmoud/ggplot2_lesson) 
* [Lesson on basic statistics (in FR)](https://demarche-stat-lesson.netlify.app/#/title-slide)
