title: "Teaching"

I am an R enthusiast and happy to share my knowledge in various fields of statistics.


You can find below two practice-based lessons that I created to teach `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. 

* [Lesson on dplyr](https://github.com/RemiMahmoud/data_wrangling)
* [Lesson on ggplot2](https://github.com/RemiMahmoud/ggplot2_lesson) 

Two lessons I teach at the [French Higher Education Institution in Agriculture, Food, Horticultural and Landscape Sciences](https://www.institut-agro-rennes-angers.fr/).
* [Lesson on basic statistics (in FR)](https://demarche-stat-lesson.netlify.app/#/title-slide) 
* [Lesson on data visualization](https://data-visualisation-lesson.netlify.app/) (more concept-based (How (not) / Why / What) than technical (How to)).
