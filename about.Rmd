As a young statistician with a keen interest in applying statistical methods to biological systems, I am currently engaged in a post-doctoral position at INRAE (Ecosys). My work involves collaborating with microbiologists from INRAE MYCSA to investigate the response of various Fusarium species to temperature and water availability. This research is crucial due to the fungi's role in causing Fusarium Head Blight, a significant threat to food safety.

Prior to my current position, I completed my PhD (downlodable [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04231881v1/document)) at INRAE (AGIR) in Toulouse. During my doctoral studies, which focused on modeling the performance of cereal-legume intercrops (crops where two species grow together to reduce the use of inputs).
